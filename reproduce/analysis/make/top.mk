# Ultimate target of this project
# -------------------------------
#
# The final paper/report (`paper.pdf') is the main target of this
# project. As defined in the Make paradigm, it must be the first target
# that Make encounters (immediately after loading the local configuration
# settings, necessary for a group building scenario mentioned next).
#
#
# Group build
# -----------
#
# This project can also be configured to have a shared build directory
# between multiple users. In this scenario, many users (on a server) can
# have their own/separate version controlled project source, but share the
# same build outputs (in a common directory). This will allow a group to
# work separately, on parallel parts of the analysis that don't
# interfere. It is thus very useful in cases were special storage
# requirements or CPU power is necessary and its not possible/efficient for
# each user to have a fully separate copy of the build directory.
#
# Controlling this requires two variables that are available at this stage:
#
#   - `GROUP-NAME': from `LOCAL.mk' (which was built by `./configure').
#   - `reproducible_paper_group_name': from the `./for-group' script (if it
#     was used to call Make).
#
# The analysis is only done when both have the same group name. Note that
# when the project isn't being built for a group, both variables will be an
# empty string.
#
#
# Only processing, no LaTeX PDF
# -----------------------------
#
# If you are just interested in the processing and don't want to build the
# PDF, you can skip the creatation of the final PDF by removing the value
# of `pdf-build-final' in `reproduce/analysis/config/pdf-build.mk'.

# Define source Makefiles
# -----------------------
#
# To keep things clean, managable and readable, each set of operations
# is (and must be) classified (modularized) by context into separate
# Makefiles: the more the better. These modular steps are then
# included in this top-level Makefile through the `include' command of
# the next step. Each Makefile should also produce a LaTeX macro file
# with the same fixed name (used to keep all the parameters and
# relevant outputs of the steps in it for the final paper).
#
# In the rare case that no special LaTeX macros are necessary in a
# workhorse Makefile, you can simply make an empty file with `touch
# $@'. This will not add any lines to the final combined LaTeX macros
# file, but will create the file that is a prerequisite to the final
# paper generation.
#
# To (significantly) help in readability, this top-level Makefile should be
# the only one in charge of including Makefiles. So if you care about easy
# maintainence and understandability (even for your self, in one year! It
# is VERY IMPORTANT and as a scientist, you MUST care about it!), do not
# include Makefiles from any other Makefile.
#
# IMPORTANT NOTE: order matters in the inclusion of the processing
# Makefiles. As the project grows, some Makefiles will define
# variables/dependencies that later Makefiles need. Therefore we are using
# a `foreach' loop in the next step to explicitly request loading them in
# the same order that they are defined here (we aren't just using a
# wild-card like the configuration Makefiles).

# Include all analysis Makefiles
# ------------------------------
#
#   1) All the analysis configuration-Makefiles (Makefiles that only define
#      variables with no rules or order).
#
#   2) From the software configuration-Makefiles, we only include the one
#      containing software versions, just incase its necessary to
#      use/report outside of the acknowledgments section of the paper.
#
#   3) Finally, we'll import all the analysis workhorse-Makefiles which
#      contain rules to actually do this project's processing.

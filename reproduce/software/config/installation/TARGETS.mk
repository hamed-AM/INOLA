# AVAILABLE SOFTWARE
# ------------------
#
# All software that are currently available for installation can be seen in
# the following file.
#
#     reproduce/software/config/installation/versions.mk
#
# Please add any software that you need for your project in the respective
# part below (using its name in `versions.mk', but without the `-version'
# part). Just note that if a program/library is a dependency of another,
# you don't need to include it here (it will be installed before the
# higher-level software anyway).
#
# Note that many low-level software will be installed before those that are
# installed in this step. They are clearly distinguished from the
# higher-level (optional) software in `versions.mk'. These low-level
# software MUST NOT be added here.





# Programs and libraries.
top-level-programs  = astrometrynet gnuastro

# Python libraries/modules.
